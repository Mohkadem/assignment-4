now in the Hero section, I wanted to do AnimatedText components. I was changing the text each 5 seconds, I noticed it it disrupting the user experience so I asked ChatGPT and it recommended to me changing the text less frequently so the user have a chance to read it and to less make noise for the user. Also it recommended that making subtitles. For example the main title is web developer and one of the subtitles could be UI/UX Lover so it makes less noise. By the way I, what I was doing is I was changing the main title and I didn't have subtitles.
For the stepsCard in the index.js, I wrote what I want (e.g. title, days needed to complete the task, simple description,etc) and I gave it to ChatGPT and asked it to fill the information.
For the Work section I turned to ChatGPT to understand how I would only display 3 cards in the page and move using right & left arrows. Also when fetching the data from Github API, I faced problems with sorting. I was getting the day (saturday 0, sunday 1, etc) and sort based on that in addition to year and month. However the results weren't correct. I asked ChatGPT and I fixed it and used the day of the month instead.
